 The picture is of King Tao. Although Sapphire is an experienced mom, this will be stunning Blue Bicolor King Tao's first litter. King Tao comes from Supreme Tica Champion lines in Idaho. His grandfather Jack is a very famous winner of many Championships. 

Tao may look very regal, but he is actually a very snuggly guy. He likes to spend hours in your lap spending time with you. 

According to the genetic Punnett Square; a device used to predict kitten colors and markings, 25%  of these kittens will mitted and 75% will be Bicolor. Most will be seal. Some may be blue.
