W﻿e will be breeding King Tao, our big beautiful blue bicolor king, to our new blue bicolor queen Queen Bailey in summer for a fall litter. 

B﻿ailey is affectionate and loving queen and when crossed with Tao will produce very lovely blue bicolor and mitted kittens with both her and Tao's extremely outgoing personalities. 

W﻿e are looking forward to this litter with much anticipation as these kittens should have very floofy silky coats. Both Bailey and Tao are silky soft to touch and despite their fluff have easy care coats. Ragdolls are known for both their amazing personalities but also their easy care coats. Ragdolls, although they are a long hair cat, lack the heavy undercoat of your other long hair breeds like Persians. As such they require little brushing and rarely get matts.
