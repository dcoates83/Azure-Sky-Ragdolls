W﻿e are a proud ALL RING sponsor of the Calgary Cat Association TICA Kittens and Blooms Cat Show April 22 and April 23, 2023. 

C﻿ome down to the Southland Leisure Centre, 2000 Southland Drive SW, Calgary, Alberta!!

T﻿ickets may be purchased at the door or online at: https://www.showpass.com/calgary-cat-show-2023 

Come see, learn about and enjoy your favorite breeds of cats :) 

T﻿he exhibitors here are all proud mentors of the average cat home; constantly teaching and supporting and promoting the proper care, training, breeding and health of ALL cats. Have a question? These are the people to meet!

Breeders promote the health of ALL breeds by selecting and breeding only those cats that exhibit the best of each breed. They also carry out the important function of selecting and breeding ONLY those cats that have been tested clear of genetic defects. All breeds have their own genetic defects. In lines not DNA tested there are many hearts broken because these kittens tend to live miserable lives suffering genetic defects, costing their Forever Homes exorbitant veterinary bills and untold heart break. 

Support your local breeders. They work HARD to uphold their breeds standards, and breed only quality cats that are free of these terrible defects. This costs them lots of money and rarely do they make much off any kitten. But they are protecting you and the welfare all ALL cats in general by removing these genetically defective cats from breeding lines. 

T﻿his is a great place to enjoy and learn about all breeds of cats. Breeders representative of all breeds will be there to show their beautiful cats and all are willing and welcome to answer questions you may have. 

C﻿ome support them and the Calgary Cat Association. They do a lot of good completely out of sight of the average cat owner. We all benefit by their unending devotion to the breeding healthy cats. 

T﻿here a﻿lso will be many booths with great kitty items to purchase!
