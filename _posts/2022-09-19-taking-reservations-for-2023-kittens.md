If you are interested in a kitten from a particular king or queen, or if you have preferences as to the color, markings or coat of your kitten, please contact us at azureskyragdolls@gmail.com with your preferences and we can point you to the litters most likely to produce the color or markings you prefer. 

Since all our kittens are socialized plus plus and because all go home altered (neutered or spayed) we encourage Forever Homes to select their kittens based on personality; not sex.

**Spring kittens tend to be reserved prior to birth or even conception so we recommend reserving your kitten now if you are planning on a Spring 2023 Forever Baby.**
