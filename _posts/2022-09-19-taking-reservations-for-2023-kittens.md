*Kittens tend to be reserved prior to birth or even conception so we recommend reserving your kitten now if you are planning on a 2023 Forever Baby.*

**Q﻿ueen Anna is our sweetness and light lilac bicolor queen. She will be crossed with King Tzar; our seal bicolor foundation king.**

**T﻿hese kittens, because they can get a dilute color gene from either parent, will be a mix of colors; seal, chocolate, blue and or lilac are all possible in this litter. All will be either bicolor or mitted white pattern.**
