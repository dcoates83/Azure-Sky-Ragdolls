 Queen Sapphire and King Tzar are seal bicolor so according to the genetic Punnett Square (a device used to predict kitten colors and markings) 25%- 50% of these kittens could mitted and 50-75% will be Bicolor. All will be seal. 

These kittens will have the easy care traditional Ragdoll coat where the undercoat is less heavy than other long hair breeds. 

Sapphire is quite bonded to Tzar. They have lovely affectionate kittens every time.

Iï»¿t appears to be 1 female (reserved) and two males.
