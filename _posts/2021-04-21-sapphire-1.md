reserved: Currently we have no retired Kings or Queens for adoption

All of our Kings and Queens are eventually retired, spayed or neutered and sold to very good homes for extremely reasonable prices. Typical retirees  are young enough for you to own for many many years, but old enough you can skip the busy kitten stage. 

If you are interested in being a home for any retirees, fill out our Adoption Form and keep in touch. We will contact you should any become available.
