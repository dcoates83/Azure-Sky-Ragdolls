Both Athena and Tao are stunning blue bicolor cats. Tao comes from championship lines and we think just  his personality alone Tao deserves an award. He is such a social guy. He is young yet and has not developed his full coat. He has already surpassed our other Kings in size  however. Tao is going to be a BIG cat. 

Athena is one of our fluffiest traditional Ragdolls and as we watch Tao develop his coat we think these kittens will be quite fluffy like their last litter. 

When you cross a bicolor with a bicolor you surprisingly do not get all bicolor kittens. You get a mix of bicolor and mitted kittens.
