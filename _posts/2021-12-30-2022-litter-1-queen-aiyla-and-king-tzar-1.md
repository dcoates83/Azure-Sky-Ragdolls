**Aiyla** is our sweet and cuddly Blue Mitted Mink Queen. Aiyla's color is still developing as she is still young. Her coat is an intense blue with an iridescent sheen to it and plusher than a traditional Ragdolls. 

**Tzar** is our Foundation Seal Bicolor Traditional Ragdoll King.

Kittens out of this crossing have all been larger Ragdolls, confident enough for living with large dogs and loving "I want to be with you" Ragdolls. Tzar carries a recessive lilac gene so there is the remote possibility of a lilac Mink, but this would be very rare. These kittens will likely be all blue Mink; Mitted, Bicolor or Colorpoint. 

**Bicolor** means they have the traditional mitts and boots of all Ragdoll but they have a white V over the nose which carries over into their ruff, bib and belly. Bicolors can have differing amounts of white over their saddle area. The saddle area can be completely colored (breed standard) or they may have white extending up and over the back in varying amounts (medium or high white). One in four kittens is always a high white when you cross a Bicolor with a Bicolor, but in this cross between a Mitted and a Bicolor likely there will be no medium to high white. If you prefer a kitten with lots of white please refer to litters from either Amethys or Athena where one would be more likely. 

**Mitted** means they have the typical Mitts and Boots of all Ragdolls but they have a completely or partially dark nose. Typically mitted kittens Mitts and Boots are separated from the rest of the kitten by an area of color so are distinct. 

**Colorpoint** means their points (ears, nose, tail) are progressively darker than the rest of the body but they have no white on them. Despite having no white, these kittens are always stunning.
