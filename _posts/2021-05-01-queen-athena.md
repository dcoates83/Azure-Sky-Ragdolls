See Facebook page for pics of these kittens; Jax, Ziggy Stardust, Coco, Snowy and River Blue. 

Athena is derived from the Greek name Athene who was the Greek Goddess of war and wisdom. While she truly is a little Goddess there is not much "war" in Athena; she is all lovey dove and much to sweet for that. She loves to sit in your lap, tell you about her day and listen while you tell her about yours. 

Athena and Tzar's kittens were a mix of blue, lilac and seal color points; mostly bicolor although one was mitted.  

Using the rules of genetics and the genetic predictor Punnett square -  50% will be bicolor (white V on face),  25% mitted (dark face with mittens and 25% high white bicolor (kittens with the extra white/not for show).

 Amethys is not a Mink, but her fluffy Polish lines produce very plush kittens.
