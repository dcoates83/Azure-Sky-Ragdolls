Athena is from Greek name Athene. It means the Greek Goddess of war and wisdom in English. While she truly is a little Goddess there is not much "war" in her; she is all lovey dove. She loves to sit in your lap, tell you about her day and listen while you tell her about yours. 

Body Color/points: Athena and Tzar's kittens will be a mix of blue, lilac and seal body colors/points.  

White markings: Using the rules of genetics and the genetic predictor Punnett square -  50% will be bicolor (white V on face),  25% mitted (dark face with mittens and 25% high white bicolor (kittens with the extra white).

 While these high white kittens *always* occur when you cross a bicolor with bicolor, and are very flashy and beautiful, they are considered pet quality only. To most owners this does not matter as they do not intend to show their kitten.  

Athena comes from very fluffy lines. She is not a Mink, but her lines produce very plush kittens.
