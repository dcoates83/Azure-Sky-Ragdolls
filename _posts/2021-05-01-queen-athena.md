Athena truly is a little Goddess. She loves to sit in your lap, tell you about her day and listen while you tell her about yours. 

Athena is from Greek name Athene. It means the Greek Goddess of war and wisdom in English

Her and Tzar's kittens will be a mix of blue, lilac and seal.  These little bundles of joy will be bicolor (white face),  mitted (dark face) and high white bicolor (extra white markings). 

Please note when you cross a bicolor with a bicolor you ALWAYS get 25% mitted, 50% bicolor and 25% high white bicolor. The high white bicolors are not considered show standard markings so while they are extremely pretty they are sold as Pet only. For the average kitten owner this does not matter but it is important we point it out. 

Athena comes from very fluffy lines. She is not a Mink, but her lines produce very plush kittens.
