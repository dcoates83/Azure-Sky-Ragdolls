Athena truly is a little Goddess. She loves to sit in your lap and tell you about her day. 

Kittens will be a mix of blue, lilac and seal bundles of joy with bicolor,  mitted and van white markings. 

Athena comes from very fluffy lines. She is not a Mink, but her lines produce very plush kittens.
