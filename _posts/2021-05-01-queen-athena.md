Athena is from Greek name Athene. It means the Greek Goddess of war and wisdom in English. While she truly is a little Goddess there is not much "war" in her; she is all lovey dove. She loves to sit in your lap, tell you about her day and listen while you tell her about yours. 

We have to wait a couple weeks to see color's and markings as are all white at birth. 

Body Color/points: Athena and Tzar's kittens will be a mix of blue, lilac and seal body colors/points. Mostly seal because seal dominates.  

White markings: Using the rules of genetics and the genetic predictor Punnett square -  50% will be bicolor (white V on face),  25% mitted (dark face with mittens and 25% high white bicolor (kittens with the extra white/not for show).

 Athena comes from very fluffy lines. She is not a Mink, but her lines produce very plush kittens.
