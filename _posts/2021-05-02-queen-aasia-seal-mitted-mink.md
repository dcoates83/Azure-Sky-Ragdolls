Queen Aasia is one of our Fluffy Mink cats and she is the sweetest pea. Minks have plusher coats, more intense coat colors and green eyes. 

Queen Aasia and King Tzar will have all seal kittens; some mitted and some bicolor.

Some of the kittens will be mink and have the plusher coat and green eyes. 

Some of the kittens will have the regular soft, easy care coats,  the less intense seal color, and blue eyes. 

Since both Aasia and Tzar are very affectionate cats we expect their kittens to be like them; mellow and attached to their owners.
