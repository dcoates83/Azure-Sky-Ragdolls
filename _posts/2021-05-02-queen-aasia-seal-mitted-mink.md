Queen Aasia is one of our Fluffy Mink cats and she is the sweetest pea. She likes to give "cat hugs"...awwww.

Queen Aasia and King Tzar will have all seal kittens; mitted or bicolor, Mink or non Mink.

Minks have plusher coats requiring more care, more intense coat colors and green eyes. The Mink kittens are born with color. 

Traditional Non Mink kittens have regular soft, easy care coats,  less intense colors, and blue eyes. 

Please note there has been much controversy about Mink Ragdolls. Some breeders still insist Minks are not Ragdolls because their green eyes do not meet Show Standards. Due to their popularity, we firmly believe a Mink class will be added in time. 

All our Minks are registered with the International Cat Association as purebred Ragdolls.

 To the average Ragdoll Pet Kitten owner this does not matter, but it is important we point it out. 

Since both Aasia and Tzar are very affectionate cats, their kittens will be very mellow, *extremely* affectionate and very *attached* to their owners.
