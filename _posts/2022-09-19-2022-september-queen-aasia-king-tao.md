A﻿asia is our exceptionally fluffy mink queen. Her kittens will require daily brushing as minks have a double gene for long hair and a thicker undercoat than traditional Ragdolls. Minks also have aqua green eyes; not blue. With her intense seal coloring Aasia's eyes are lovely indeed as they contrast beautifully with her seal coat. 

T﻿ao is our big beautiful blue bicolor King from championship lines in Idaho. We purchased him in 2021 so 2022 was his first year being a dad and he did extremely well. All the kittens out of him have been just like him; very affectionate. Because Tao is not full grown yet but already is an athletic, muscular King with good size. We anticipate him to fill out about 18 pounds. He will continue to grow, develop his coat and his color until age 4. 

T﻿hese kittens are very affectionate- like both their parents. Both Tao and Aasia like to stay right with you, and are "get along" cats. They will fit into any family.
