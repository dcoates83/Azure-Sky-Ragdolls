A﻿asia is our exceptionally fluffy mink queen. Her kittens will require daily brushing as minks have a double gene for long hair and a thicker undercoat than traditional Ragdolls. Minks also have aqua green eyes; not blue. With her intense seal coloring Aasia's eyes are lovely indeed as they contrast beautifully with her seal coat. 

A﻿asia's seal mink genes tend to dominate so she tends to have all seal kittens when crossed with Tao who is blue bicolor. Her kittens are mitted, bicolor or colorpoint. We anticipate these kittens to inherit their father Tao's large size and loving personality.
