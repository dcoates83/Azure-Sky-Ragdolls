King Tzar is a stunning Seal point Traditional bicolor Ragdoll who likes to sleep with our Head Nanny; German Shepherd Nanny Sophia. 

Queen Aiyla is our blue, mitted Mink Queen who-- although is your typically sweet Ragdoll--will indeed give the resident doggo Nannies a "what for" if needed. Aiyla has a very soft meow and loves to snuggle in our laps, but her kittens will be well suited for a household with large dogs as they will have the confidence needed to coexist with larger dog breeds. To date Aiyla's kittens have always been larger than other kittens the same age. 

Aiyla is young yet so has yet to develop her full coat or coat color at age 3 or 4. Each month her coat gets plusher and her blue more intense; with an iridescent sheen to it. 

Although all are registered purebred Ragdolls, Mink Ragdolls differ from your tradtional Ragdolls in that they are born with color,  have very plush coats due to a double gene for long hair, their colors are more intense and their eyes are a stunning aqua green. 

This litter will be a mix of Bicolor (white face), Mitted (dark face) and Color point (no white, dark points). All will be Mink kittens and require daily brushing due to their extra plush coats. Minks are like all other Ragdolls in that they are not full size, color, coat thickness until age 3-4. Ragdolls are slow to mature.
