King Tao is our newest blue bicolor King from Heavenlyrags in Idaho. He is going to be a big cat; all muscle already. He has perfect markings and a personality to match.. 

Queen Athena is our sweetness and light Blue Bicolor Queen.

Athena is a very fluffy girl. Each month her coat gets plusher; reflecting her Polish lines.  Blue is a soft color and the second most common color in Ragdolls. 

All these kittens will be blue; either Bicolor (Pink nose/white V over nose) or Mitted (dark nose).
