King Tzar is a stunning Seal point Traditional bicolor Ragdoll who likes to sleep with our Head Nanny; German Shepherd Nanny Sophia. 

Queen Athena is our sweetness and light Blue Bicolor Queen.

Athena is young yet so has yet to develop her full coat or coat color at age 3 or 4. Each month her coat gets plusher; reflecting her lines.  Blue is a soft color and the second most common color in Ragdolls. 

Because King Tzar carries a recessive Lilac gene which competes equally with Blue, these kittens could be Blue, Lilac, or Seal. In recent litters from these two most kittens were Blue Bicolor. All these kittens will be either Bicolor (Pink nose/white V over nose) or Mitted (dark nose). Some will have a lot of white.
