King Tzar is a stunning Seal point Traditional bicolor Ragdoll who likes to sleep with our Head Nanny; German Shepherd Nanny Sophia. 

Queen Amethys is our sweetness and light Lilac Bicolor Queen.

Amethys is young yet so has yet to develop her full coat or coat color at age 3 or 4. Each month her coat gets plusher. Lilacs are a very soft color; barely perceptible until they are over 6 months old, and they stay a light colored cat.
