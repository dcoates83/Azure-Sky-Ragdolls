**A﻿iyla** always has great kid cats or for people with dogs. They have the confidence for these busy lives. **Tao** is our largest king so we expect them to become large Ragdolls. He is also a completely snuggly type of fellow. 

**T﻿ao** is our blue bicolor king from championship lines that produces big beautiful kittens with amazing coats and personalities.
