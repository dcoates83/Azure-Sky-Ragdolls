**A﻿iyla** always has great kid cats or for people with dogs. They have the confidence for these busy lives. **Tao** is our largest king so we expect them to become large Ragdolls. He is also a completely snuggly type of fellow. 

**O﻿din**- blue mink mitted male with tippy toe mitts (AVAILABLE)

**O﻿phelia**- blue mink mitted female with raccoon face (nose is dark but whisker area is white). Medium mitts. 

Please consult us as to their personalities or view with a live Facebook messenger call :)
