Both king Tzar (Seal point Bicolor carries recessive Lilac gene) and queen Amethys (Bicolor Lilac Queen) are warm fuzzies.  

 Tzar sleeps with our dog every night and asks to be brushed every evening (though he does not need it). Amethys has a quiet meow, which she uses to ask you for cuddles. Since this is her first litter, her coat will get much fluffier until age 3-4.  It is still an easy care coat. Combing each night is not necessary as it rarely gets tangles... though she does ask to be brushed. 

Kittens out of Amethys and King Tzar will be a mix of Seal and Lilac kittens; mostly seal because seal dominates. 

Because Tzar carries the Lilac gene, they can produce Lilac kittens , but most will not be. Some will be seal colored (phenotype) but carry the recessive gene for lilac (genotype).  To get a lilac kitten we need both Tzar and Amethys providing a lilac gene to one kitten. This is possible but will not occur often.

White markings: Using the rules of genetics and the genetic predictor Punnett square -  50% of the kittens should be bicolor (white V on face),  25% mitted (dark face with mittens and 25% high white bicolor (kittens with the extra white/not for show).
