King Tzar is a seal point Bicolor and carries the recessive Lilac gene. Tzar sleeps with our dog every night and asks to be brushed every evening (though he does not need it). 

 Queen Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor  Queen. Amethys has a quiet meow which she uses to ask you for cuddles. Amethys continues to get fluffier and will do so until age 3-4.  Despite her coat being fluffy, it's an easy care coat. Combing each night is not necessary as it rarely gets tangles although she does ask to be brushed. 

Kittens out of Amethys and King Tzar will always be mostly seal because Tzar's seal gene will dominate. This litter was mostly Seal point, but there were also a very stunning Chocolate and a beautiful Lilac kitten. They were all bicolor except for one mitted kitten. All of these kittens I called "exceptionally friendly kittens".  The vet and vet techs commented at their health check ups just how social and loving these kittens all were. To see pictures of these kittens go to our Facebook page posts and look for Bodhi, Fritz, Carlos, Marcos and Sir Soba. 

To get a lilac kitten we needed both Tzar and Amethys providing their lilac gene to one kitten and no seal gene from Tzar; so lilac kittens like Fritz are rare. 

Using the rules of genetics and the genetic predictor Punnett square -  50% of the kittens should be bicolor (white V on face),  25% mitted (dark face with mittens and 25% high white bicolor (kittens with the extra white/not for show).

Amethys next litter will be late February/early March 2022.
