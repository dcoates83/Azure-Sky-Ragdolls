King Tzar is a seal point Bicolor and carries the recessive Lilac gene. Tzar sleeps with our dog every night and asks to be brushed every evening (though he does not need it). 

 Queen Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor  Queen. Amethys has a quiet meow which she uses to ask you for cuddles. Amethys continues to get fluffier and will do so until age 3-4.  Despite her coat being fluffy, it's an easy care coat. Combing each night is not necessary as it rarely gets tangles although she does ask to be brushed. 

Kittens out of Amethys and King Tzar are always mostly seal because Tzar's seal gene will dominate. This litter there was also a very stunning Chocolate and a beautiful Lilac kitten. They were all Bicolor except for one Mitted kitten. All of these kittens I called the "exceptionally friendly kittens".  The vet and vet techs commented at each of their health check ups how social and loving these kittens all were; even to strangers. To see pictures of these kittens go to our Facebook page posts and look for Bodhi, Fritz, Carlos, Marcos and Sir Soba. 

To get a Lilac kitten, we needed both Tzar and Amethys providing their lilac gene to one kitten and no seal gene from Tzar dominating. Lilac kittens like Fritz are rare. 



Amethys next litter will be late February/early March 2022.
