Queen Amethys is our lovely Bicolor Van Lilac Queen. She is an extremely sweet cat. 

Kittens out of her and King Tzar will be a mix of Seal and Lilac kittens. Because Tzar carries the Lilac gene they can have Lilac kittens. Most will be Seal however because Seal dominates over Lilac. 

White markings will be a mix of Bicolor, Mitted and Bicolor Van. These will be extremely pretty kittens and be a bit fluffier than your usual Ragdoll because Amethys comes from very fluffy lines.
