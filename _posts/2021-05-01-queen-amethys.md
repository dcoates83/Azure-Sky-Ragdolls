Queen Amethys is our lovely Bicolor Van Lilac Queen. She is an extremely sweet cat. 

Kittens out of her and King Tzar will be a mix of Seal and Lilac kittens. Because Tzar carries the Lilac gene they can have Lilac kittens , but most will be Seal because the Seal gene dominates over Lilac. To get a lilac kitten we need both Tzar and Amethys providing a lilac gene to one kitten. 

White markings will be a mix of Bicolor, Mitted and Bicolor Van. These will be extremely pretty kittens and be a bit fluffier than your usual Ragdoll because Amethys comes from very fluffy lines.

Both Tzar and Amethys have exceptionally social personalities. Tzar especially sleeps with our dog every night and asks for his pets. Amethys has a quite meow which she uses to ask you for cuddles and brushing. Although her coat will get much fluffier due to her heritage, it is still an easy care coat. She asks for combing each night but it is not necessary as it rarely gets tangles.
