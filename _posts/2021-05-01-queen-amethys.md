Queen Amethys is our lovely Bicolor Lilac Queen. She is an extremely sweet cat. 

Kittens out of her and King Tzar will be a mix of Seal and Lilac kittens. Because Tzar carries the Lilac gene they can have Lilac kittens , but most will be Seal because the Seal gene dominates over Lilac. To get a lilac kitten we need both Tzar and Amethys providing a lilac gene to one kitten. This is possible but there will not be many. 

White markings will be a mix of Bicolor, Mitted and High White Bicolor. These will be extremely pretty kittens and be a bit fluffier than your usual Ragdoll because Amethys comes from very fluffy lines. 

Please remember that you ALWAYS get 25% high white bicolor kittens when you cross a bicolor with a bicolor, BUT these kittens do not meet show/breed standard for markings. They are very pretty so most Pet Kitten owners do not care, but it is important we make that clear. 

Both Tzar and Amethys have exceptionally social personalities. Tzar especially sleeps with our dog every night and asks for his pets. Amethys has a quiet meow which she uses to ask you for cuddles and brushing. Although her coat will get much fluffier due to her heritage, it is still an easy care coat. She asks for combing each night but it is not necessary as it rarely gets tangles.
