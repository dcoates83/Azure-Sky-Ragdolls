All these kittens from Sapphire and Tzar have amazing Forever Homes  and snuggly, social personalities :)

When you cross a bicolor with a bicolor you *always* have 3 white patterns in the resultant kittens:

 50% bicolor, 25% mitted, 25% bicolor high white (lots of white, very pretty but cannot be used for show). Most Pet owners do not care they cannot show a high white kitten; they just wanted a happy, healthy, beautiful kitten. High white kittens are indeed very pretty kittens, but it's important you know this. 

 Tzar carries a recessive lilac gene and Sapphire carries a recessive blue gene. To get either a lilac or a blue kitten  requires *both parents* must contribute their recessive color gene to one  kitten.  In genetics, the recessive blue and lilac genes carry equal weight so if a kitten received both of their recessive color genes it could be either a lilac or a blue kitten. 

Next litter from Sapphire is anticipated early summer 2022.
