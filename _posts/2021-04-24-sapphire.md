*All these kittens from Sapphire and Tzar are reserved and have amazing Forever Homes :)*

They all have snuggly, social personalities, and are currently keeping Nanny Sophia, our German Shepherd, busy. 

We do not plan to breed Sapphire again until 2022. Sapphire always puts everything into her kittens as she is such a good mom, and she deserves a good, long break from having kittens. 

When you cross a bicolor with a bicolor you *always* have 3 types of kittens:

 50% bicolor and  25% mitted which are breed standard. 

 25% bicolor high white which are not considered breed standard.

 Pet owners do not care as long as they get a happy, healthy kitten and these are indeed very pretty kittens, but it's important you know these ones do not qualify for show. 

 Tzar carries a recessive lilac gene and Sapphire carries a recessive blue gene. In genetics both blue and lilac are recessive genes carry equal weight. To get either a lilac or a blue kitten  requires *both parents* must contribute their same recessive gene color to one  kitten. So to get a blue you need a blue gene from both parents or a lilac a lilac gene from both parents. We believe that the lighter seal kittens we get from Tzar and Sapphire are the result of both of these recessive genes trying to express themselves at once.

Next litter from Sapphire is anticipated 2022. We have 2 reservations on that litter.
