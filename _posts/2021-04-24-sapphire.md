*All these kittens from Sapphire and Tzar are reserved and have wonderful Forever Homes :)*

They all have snuggly social personalities and are currently busy bothering Nanny Sophia, the dog.

Often Sapphire and Tzar have a lighter colored seal kitten that we cannot call blue...but it is definitely lighter color than the regular seals. they are exceptionally pretty cats. If you look on our Facebook page for Alabaster Binx and Bright Dandelion both of these were these lighter seal kittens; very beautiful kittens indeed. Both also have exceptional personalities. This litter we have two kittens like this. 

We do not plan to breed Sapphire again until 2022. Sapphire always puts everything into her kittens as she is such a good mom, and she deserves a good, long break from having kittens. 

When you cross a bicolour with a bicolor you *always* have 3 types of kittens:

Seal bicolor

Seal mitted

Seal bicolor high white 

With Sapphire and Tzar there is also sometimes is a "lighter" seal bicolor kitten. We think this is because Tzar carries a recessive lilac gene and Sapphire carries a recessive blue gene.  We  think we are getting these light seal kittens due to recessive genes partially expressing themselves. In genetics both blue and lilac are recessive genes carry equal weight. To get either a lilac or a blue kitten  requires *both parents* must contribute their same recessive gene color to one  kitten. So to get a blue you need a blue gene from both parents. We believe that the lighter seal kittens we get from Tzar and Sapphire are the result of both of these recessive genes trying to express themselves at once.
