Aasia is a MINK Ragdoll. As such her coat is very plush, her colors intense and her eyes green. Mink Ragdolls have the plushest coats and most intense colors of all Ragdolls. 

Aasia is an absolute Sweet Pea. Extremely loving and social, she will produce very stunning kittens. 

Kittens out of Aasia and Tzar will all be seal and will be a mix of bicolor and mitted but mostly mitted. Vans ( lots of white) are not expected out of this litter. 

Warning: Aasia has the heaviest coat of all our Queens. She requires daily brushing. If you want a kitten requiring less care we suggest you purchase a kitten from our regular coat Ragdolls; Athena, Amethys or Sapphire.
