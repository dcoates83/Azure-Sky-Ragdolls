**These kittens should be all Seal colored. There will be a mix of mitted, bicolor and van kittens.**

 Often her van kittens are a lighter seal color; reflecting her recessive blue genes and Tzar's recessive lilac genes. These lighter Vans cannot be considered true blue or lilac. but do stay a lighter seal body color than the other seal kittens. If you check out our Azure Sky Ragdolls Facebook page, look for the pictures of the kittens Alabaster Binx, Bright Dandelion, or Lemon for pictures of these van lighter seal colored kittens. 

Because there is always the remote possibility **both** Tzar's recessive blue and Sapphire's recessive blue may combine in one kitten, a lilac or an blue is possible but this would be rare. Most kittens will be seal.
