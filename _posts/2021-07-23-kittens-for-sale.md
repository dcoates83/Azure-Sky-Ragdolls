All our current kittens have Forever Homes already. **We are taking reservations for all 2022 litters.** 

**Kittens are offered in this order:** 

1. To **depositors** in the order of the date we received their Deposit. 
2. All kittens are by reservation;  you must fill out our Adoption Application, be pre approved and place deposit. Most kittens are reserved by the time they are born so it's important to place a deposit early to reserve your kitten. |A 1-2 litter wait is normal for all reputable catteries.

   Please fill out our Adoption Application on our website azureskyragdolls.com. Because most kittens are reserved prior to birth or even conception it is recommended you reserve a kitten as early as possible by placing a deposit of half the price of your kitten. Contact us at azureskyragdolls@gmail.com re price. 

   **All kittens go home with three sets of vaccines, fully wormed (minimum 3x), microchipped, altered and with a genetic Health Guarantee.**
