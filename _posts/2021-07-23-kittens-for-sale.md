No kittens are available for sale right now. 

All our current baby fuzzies are reserved. Typically there is a 2 litter wait. 

We are making a Secure Waitlist from those who fill out our Adoption Application.

When the current depositors' reservations are filled, then we will offer any  not reserved to the  people on the Secure Waitlist and they will  be asked to place a reserve a kitten by placing a deposit. If they choose not to reserve at this time we move to the next person and remove their name from our waitlist.

Kittens are offered in this order: 

1. To depositors in the order of the date we received their Deposit. 

2. To people on the Secure Waitlist in the order of the date we received their Adoption Application.
