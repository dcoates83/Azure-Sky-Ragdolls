N﻿aoki is an extremely friendly boy and gets along with dogs well. He is always trying to head butt our dog kitten nannies. 

V﻿ery sweet and a a totally "raggy" Ragdoll in his personality. He loves to follow you around and simply lives to be picked up and cuddled. 

Although at first glance Naoki appears to be a bicolor because he has a lovely white V over his nose and a white bib continuous with this belly, he is considered a high mitted Ragdoll because he has a few color spots on his front legs. 

A﻿s a chocolate Ragdolls his points will be a warmer brown than a Seal Ragdolls. Because he is just young (only 6 months old) his full coat color and fluffiness are not complete. He will continue to intensify his points and his saddle area will get darker; although not as dark of his ears. All Ragdolls are slow to mature; taking 4 years to get their full size, coat color and coat thickness. All Amethys kittens have come to be very beautiful fluffy kittens with amazing personalities. The vet staff always have commented on how extremely friendly her kittens are. 

He is yet to be neutered and chipped and his price will reflect that. He goes home with an alter agreement. He was kept back as a breeder for someone but unfortunately life circumstances necessitated they wait for a later litter.
