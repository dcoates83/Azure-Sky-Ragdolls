Q﻿ueen Athena and King Tao are both blue bicolor and both are extremely loving cats. These kittens already are showing how friendly they are; "storming" the door of the nursery whenever I go in, despite just barely walking lol.

1﻿ Kitten girl; blue mitted Soleil, is under evaluation as a future queen as Queen Athena is retiring after this litter. Soleil is showing a lot of spunk and cuddle abilities lol. 

1﻿ blue bicolor girl; Seraphim. Seraphim is a girly girl but only in the way that she is adorably cute BUT also is a confident kitten and has her own mind. She we think would do well in a home with another kitten. 

1﻿ blue mitted male with bicolor white v face. Solaris. This little guy actually has color on his front legs; separating his toes from his shoulder so although he has a white v over his nose he is considered a mitted kitten. 

1﻿ blue bicolor male Sultan. This kitten is very light colored. He is a saucy little guy; ready to play and snuggle at all times. 

A﻿ll are quite floofy already. See Facebook page for current pictures of Athena and Tao's litter. 

F﻿ill out our adoption application on this website.
