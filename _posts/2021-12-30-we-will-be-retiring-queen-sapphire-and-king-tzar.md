 Sapphire will be retiring as soon as we get a future queen and king out of her; likely early 2023. Sapphire has been an exceptionally wonderful queen, and deserves a quiet, loving home and be spoiled rotten.

In order to continuously improve out lines, and stay a small cattery where all cats have a normal pet life with lots of loving attention, it is necessary we retire Breeders. We retire all our queens young; at age 3-5. Since the average lifespan of cats is 20,  retirees still can have nice long lives as beloved pets , but their Forever Home gets to skip the sometimes annoying kitten stage,  and have the added bonus that their cat has been DNA tested clear of genetic disease, tested negative for Felv/Fiv, been properly vaccinated and wormed, is registered with TICA, and has been microchipped and has an already paid-for lifetime account with Eidap.

Because our priority is finding a loving Forever Home for Sapphire, she will be sold for a small fee that covers her alter and updates her vaccines. **She must altered prior to leaving.** 

We would prefer Sapphire go to a single person's home who has no children or dogs as Sapphire has already "done her duty" with children and dog nannies. She deserves a quiet Forever Home with 1:1 attention.

If you are interested in providing a retirement home for Sapphire, please fill out our Adoption Application indicating you would like to adopt her specifically.
