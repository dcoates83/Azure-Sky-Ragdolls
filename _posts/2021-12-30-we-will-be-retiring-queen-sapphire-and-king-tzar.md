It is our unfortunate, but necessary duty to sometimes retire kings and queens. In order to continuously improve out lines and yet stay a small cattery where all cats have a normal life it is necessary we retire our Breeders.

Sapphire and Tzar will be retiring as soon as we get a future queen and king out of them.

Sapphire has been an exceptionally wonderful queen, and Tzar a reliable and loving King for us, both deserve a loving home to live out their lives as a beloved Pets for the next 16 years of their lives. 

Both have tested genetically clear of hypertrophic myopathy, polycystic disease, Felv and Fiv as well as many other things. 

We retire all our cats young. This allows them to be adopted out to their Forever Homes fairly young at age 3 or 4, have nice long lives as normal house cats and so Forever Homes get a cat with many many years ahead of it. Since the average age of cats is 20; this means retirement homes still get a cat with a long life ahead of it; usually 16 years, but skip the sometimes annoying kitten stage.

\*\**All retired queens and kings are fully vaccinated and must altered prior to leaving or have an alter clause in their Sales Agreement. 

Because our priority is finding these retired breeders amazing loving homes, some where they will as loved by their Forever Home as they have been loved by us. As such they will be sold basically for the price of their vaccines, alter and microchip; around 750$ or 1500$ for both.  Our priority is a good home for these special cats. 

All retirement homes are thoroughly screened,  and we prefer our retired cats to people we have already know, but this not always so. If you think you would be a exceptional home for Sapphire and Tzar, please fill out our Adoption Application indicating you would like to adopt a retiree. 

Please note we would prefer Sapphire and Tzar to go to a quiet home with no children. Both have done their duty with "children", and deserve a nice quiet retirement Forever Home.
