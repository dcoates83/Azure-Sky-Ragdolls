 Sapphire is retiring on 20230121 to an amazing Forever Home. 

Sapphire has been an exceptionally wonderful queen, and we know will have a quiet, loving home and be spoiled rotten in the way she so deserves. 

In order to continuously improve out lines, and stay a small cattery where all cats have lots of loving attention, it is necessary we retire Kings and Queens between ages 3-5. 

Since the average lifespan of cats is 20,  retirees still can have nice long lives as beloved pets , but their Forever Home gets to skip the sometimes annoying kitten stage.  Forever Homes have the added bonus that their cat has been DNA tested clear of genetic disease, tested negative for Felv/Fiv, been properly vaccinated and wormed, is registered with TICA, has been microchipped and has an already paid-for lifetime account with Eidap.  

If you are interested in providing a retirement home for retiring kings and queens, please fill out our Adoption Application indicating you would like to adopt one.
