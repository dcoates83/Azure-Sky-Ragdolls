This litter is Blue Mink Mitted Queen Aiyla crossed with Seal Bicolor King Tzar.

Kittens will be a mixture of Seal and Blue color kittens. For white markings there will be bicolor and mitted kittens.

 Some of the kittens will be Mink with green eyes and have the denser coat and the more intense colors of a Mink. The other kittens will have the soft coat of a typical Ragdoll which requires less brushing and bathing.
