Tzar and Aayla's kittens will be a mix of Seal and Blue kittens.  

For white markings there will be bicolor and mitted kittens.

 Half of the kittens will be Mink; having green eyes,  a plusher coat, the more intense blue color of a Mink and have color at birth. These kittens will require daily brushing due to their plusher coats. 

Half of the kittens will be traditional Ragdolls; with blue eyes, be entirely white at birth and have the soft, less plush coat of a typical Ragdoll. the advantage to these kittens is they require minimal brushing and bathing. 

Aayla is young yet so her full coat is yet to develop. She is a more intense gray (blue) typical of a Mink.  Her coat has a lustrous silver sheen that is increasing every day, and will do so until she is age 4. 

Aayla is an Arabic name meaning heavens, highborn or exalted. In Hebrew it means "to climb, rising, ascending". In Hawaiian it means high exalted. 

Aiyla is a very sweet quiet yet confident queen.  She takes over the dog bed daily from Nanny Sophia, our resident German Shepherd without argument. Those with big dogs or having small children would do well having one of her more confident kittens where the kitten needs to be assertive.  I usually wake up to this delightful girl snuggled up to me.
