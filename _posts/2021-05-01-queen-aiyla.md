Tzar and Aayla's kittens will be a mix of Seal and Blue kittens.  

For white markings there will be bicolor and mitted kittens.

All the healthy little bundles of joy appear to be Mink because they were all born with significant color. We will have to wait and see if they are blue and or seal

 If the kittens are Mink they differ from traditional Ragdolls; having green eyes,  a plusher coat, a more intense color and have color at birth. These kittens will require daily brushing due to their plusher coats. 

Aayla is young yet so her full coat is yet to develop. She is a more intense gray (blue) typical of a Mink.  Her coat has a lustrous silver sheen that is increasing every day, and will do so until she is age 4. 

Aayla is an Arabic name meaning heavens, highborn or exalted. In Hebrew it means "to climb, rising, ascending". In Hawaiian it means high exalted.
