Tzar and Aayla's kittens in this litter were all blue minks; a bicolor, a mitted and a colorpoint.

Minks differ from traditional Ragdolls. Minks have color at birth, and have aqua green eyes, a plusher coat, and more intense color. Due to their double gene for long hair, Minks' plusher coats require daily brushing. Sepia Minks like Aiyla have the plushest, softest coats of all Ragdolls.

Aayla is young yet so her full coat has yet to develop. She is a very intense gray (blue) typical of a sepia Mink.  Her coat has a lustrous silver sheen that is increasing every day, and will do so until she is age 4. 

Aayla is an Arabic name meaning heavens, highborn or exalted. In Hebrew it means "to climb, rising, ascending". In Hawaiian it means "high exalted".

Aiyla's next litter will be in March 2022 and will also be out of Tzar.
