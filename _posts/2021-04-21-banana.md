Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor Van Queen. Lilac is a recessive gene; dilute chocolate.

Kittens out of Tzar and Amethys will be a mix of Seal and Lilac bicolor, mitted and van kittens. Most will be seal because Tzar's seal genes will dominate. 

We may get one of those "lighter seal" van kittens like Dandelion here. 

Lilacs are rare and truly stunning. We are working on purchasing a Lilac King so that in later litters we can get more Lilac kittens. 

Amethys is a very loving cat. She loves to follow us around and wants her bedtime cuddles.
