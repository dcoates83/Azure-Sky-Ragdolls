Q﻿ueen Aasia has given us many lovely extremely loving and beautiful kittens and now deserves a loving retirement home. After her current litter is weaned, Aasia will be retired in June. 

A﻿ll our breeding queens are retired at a young age; age 3-4, so they still can have a long and loving life with their Forever Homes as ladies of leisure. 

P﻿lease fill out our adoption application indicating you would be interested in adopting Queen Aasia. 

Homes for retiring queens are charged zero purchase price BUT must alter, update vaccines and have the queen's teeth cleaned under anesthesia. We also prefer homes where there are no children and no other pets as these retiring ladies totally deserve to be doted upon and although they are great with other cats, other pets and with people, we like them to have what we would define as a "cat mom"; someone who is willing to devote their entire attention to this lady.

P﻿roof of alter, vaccine update (if needed) and teeth cleaning is required as specified in the Sales Agreement. 

D﻿ADs are also welcome!!!!!

A﻿ll retired breeders have had the additional FIV Felv and DNA testing already done. They also have a lifetime microchip account which will be transferred to the new owner.
