Aasia is our very sweetest cat and gives cat "hugs". She reaches up with both paws, stretching her front legs out until you pick her up. So cute! 

She wants to spend every minute where you are and is very chatty. If you don't want a kitten that talks to you a lot don't get an Aasia kitten. She is thoroughly heart broken if she is not allowed to be with you. 

Mink Queen Aasia is also our fluffiest cat. All her kittens will have a double gene for long hair so will require brushing every day. They will also have light aqua green (not blue) eyes that contrast beautifully with her dark Seal coat. There will be Mitted, Bicolor and Colorpoint kittens who are very social and playful. 

King Tzar is sweet but less chatty than Queen Aasia; preferring only an occasional meow letting you know he would like to be brushed or picked up.
