Aasia is our Seal Mink Mitted Queen; known for her love of giving "cat hugs". All her kittens have her exquisite coat color and their white markings contrast beautifully with their coat color and Caribbean Sea Green mink eyes. 

K﻿ing Tzar, our foundation male soon to be retired, has made many lovely kittens with Aasia. All have turned out to have their parents loving personalities. Tzar is a traditional seal bicolor Ragdoll.
