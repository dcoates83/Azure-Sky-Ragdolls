Queen Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor sweetness and light. She is a loving, snuggly kind of cat and takes very good care of her kittens; never wanting to wean them. 

All Amethys kittens have been known for their exceptionally friendly personalities and love for their Forever Home Dog buddies. 

Tao is our treasured blue bicolor King imported from Heavenlyrags in Idaho. He comes from lines of Tica champions and you can tell this from both his amazing personality and his stunning appearance.
