Naoki, an extremely friendly chocolate bicolor male kitten is looking for his forever home. Equally good as a lap cat or an an adventure cat, this kittens personality and confidence mean he would be a great cat for kids and dogs OR just a one person cuddler. 

Nï»¿aoki is out of: 

Queen Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor sweetness and light. She is a loving, snuggly kind of cat and takes very good care of her kittens; never wanting to wean them. 



King Tzar is our Seal Bicolor Foundation King. Tzar is a quiet cat; preferring to hang around wherever you are, and likes sleeping with our German Shepherd Nanny Sophia. Tzar is a very good father; always stepping up to babysit so Momma gets a break. 

See our Facebook page for pictures of the last litter this same cross in summer 2021. Look for kittens named Sir Soba, Fritz, Carlos, Bodhi and Marcos. They all turned out very fluffy and friendly.
