These kittens will be exceptionally friendly as in past litters with this cross and will be a mix of Seal (mostly), Lilac and Chocolate Bicolor and Mitted kittens. 

Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor sweetness and light. She is a loving, snuggly kind of cat and takes very good care of her kittens; never wanting to wean them. 

Tzar is our Seal Bicolor Foundation King. Tzar is a quiet cat; preferring to hang around wherever you are, and likes sleeping with our German Shepherd Nanny Sophia. Tzar is a very good father; always stepping up to babysit so Momma gets a break. 

See our Facebook page for pictures of the last litter this cross in summer 2021. Look for kittens named Sir Soba, Fritz, Carlos, Bodhi and Marcos.
