Queen Amethys is our Lilac Bicolor sweetness and light. She is a loving, snuggly kind of cat and takes very good care of her kittens; never wanting to wean them. 

See our Facebook page for pictures of  Amethys previous kittens . Look for kittens named Naoki, Artie, Beni, Indy, Nathan, Azlan, Sir Soba, Fritz, Carlos, Bodhi and Marcos. As is typical of Amethys kittens; all were very friendly, fluffy and beautiful. 

Tao is our treasured blue bicolor King imported from Heavenlyrags in Idaho. He comes from lines of Tica champions and you can tell this from both his amazing personality and his stunning appearance. 

Pictures of Tao's recent kittens are on our Azure Sky Ragdolls Facebook page; Sodium, Qi and Birdie look like the kittens that will be produced out of this cross.
