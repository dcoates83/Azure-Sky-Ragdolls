              ><span class="underline">2-Litter Limit Option:</span> if we
              cannot provide you with a kitten within the next 2 litters your

          <p>
            <strong>Payment Plans</strong> are available at our discretion. Our
            priority is good homes for our kittens. We do not mind helping those
            who are struggling.<em>
              Payments are divided into 8 for total purchase price or into 4 if
              payment plan applies only to the deposit.</em
            >
            Except for the 1st payment, payments are due on the 1st day of every
            month. Any balance due must be paid a minimum of 1 week prior to
            pick up of kitten. Your spot on the reserve list is the date of the
            first payment on the payment plan if all payments are on time and in
            full.
