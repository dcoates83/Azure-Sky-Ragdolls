          <h2 class="header">Ragdolls history</h2>
          <p class="text">In the 1960s a longhaired cat named Josephine produced
            several litters. Ragdolls originated in Riverside,
            California with a woman named Ann Baker. Josephine, a <a rel="noreferrer"

            cats, one of which had the <a  rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_cat" title="Siamese cat"><span class="underline">Siamese</span></a> point coloration. All the kittens had docile, placid temperaments, affectionate natures, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up.

            Subsequent litter produced more of the same. Ann Baker believed that she had something special. Set out to create what is now known as the Ragdoll. She selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, pointed coloration, and a tendency to go limp when picked up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all black Burmese-like male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.

            Anne was extremely capitalistic. She tried to patent her Ragdoll breed, enacting a
            fee from anyone else breeding them. While we appreciate Anne for bringing about the
            Ragdoll breed, we are thankful other breeders took over establishing Ragdolls as a new breed. Breeders separated themselves from Anne and worked to establish the Ragdoll as
            a new breed; eligible for registration with the cat registries.

            Most strangely the most well-known Ragdoll, which greatly enhanced public interest in
            Ragdolls in the 1990’s was NOT a Ragdoll - the internet sensation Grumpy Cat. While
            Grumpy Cat had the markings of your typical Ragdoll, he was of unknown mixed breeds.
            He had multiple genetic defects; producing his grumpy appearance, a large underbite
            and feline dwarfism. He became an internet sensation quickly, stirring a lot of interest in
            the color and markings typical of Ragdolls. Today Ragdolls retain their own fans based
            on their loving natures and NON grumpy appearance. Their beauty and loving natures
            have kept Ragdolls one of the 10 most popular cat breeds in the world.

          <h1 class="header-2 center">Appearance</h1>
          <p class="">All Ragdolls get their color points from their Siamese/Birman heritage. The most known Ragdoll coloring and marking combination is called the Bicolor. We give you explanations of Ragdoll color and markings later, Bicolors are characterized by white markings overlaying the dark points. Bicolors have white boots, mitts, belly, bib, and a white V over the nose.</p>

          <h3 class="header">Eyes</h3>
          <p class="">
            Unlike other cat’s eyes who change from Blue, most Ragdolls eyes stay an intense
            shade of Blue. Mink Ragdolls, where different combinations of the Birman gene can be
            expressed, usually have Aqua green eyes and a Lilac’s stunning, almost iridescent
            Blue. While Mink eyes can be gold, most are green. Non-Mink Ragdolls always have Blue
            eyes.</p>

          <h3 class="header">personality</h3>
          <p>Ragdolls are most known for their laid back, dog-like personalities. This does not mean
            that kittens do not go through the usual period of getting the Zoomies and throwing you
            some attitude here and there, but for the most part they are weirdly easy to get along
            with. Unlike other cat breeds, Ragdolls LIKE to be with you. They are not aloof and tend
            to follow you around like a dog.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3 class="header">Fur</h3>
          <p>Ragdolls have extremely silky, luxurious fur to touch. It’s hard to describe until you feel it.
            Ragdolls lack the thick undercoat typical of other Long Hair breeds. The length of the
            hair strands is the same, but it is much easier to care for; rarely matting and requiring infrequent brushing or bathing. Since Minks have the plushest coat, I would recommend
            brushing those ones more frequently.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3 class="header">Maturation</h3>
          <p>All Ragdolls are slow to mature. They become large cats with females attaining 10-15
            lbs. and males 15-20 lbs. They do not attain full size, coat color or coat density until age
            4. This means they get bigger, fluffier, and prettier…but it takes time!</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3 class="header">Most are born white</h3>
          <p>Most Ragdolls are born completely white with their color developing over 3-4 years. After the first few week’s colors deepen and white markings become more apparent. The points become darker because of an interesting chemical change wherever the cat is a cooler temperature. Inside their mothers’ womb, they are kept a consistently warm temperature, and because of this they stay white. Once they leave the womb, everywhere else is a cooler temperature and this makes their fur become darker.</p>

          <h3 class="header">intelligence</h3>
          <p>Highly intelligent, Ragdolls can be trained to do many things including to play fetch and
            be leash trained.</p>

              <h4>Things to remember:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Color</strong> refers to the main body color of the cat.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Genes</strong> dictate what we look like.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Markings</strong> refers to the white areas.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ul>
                <p><strong>“Dominant”</strong> genes <em>always</em> show over <strong>“Recessive"</strong> genes. Some genes are even more dominant than others. Like people, cats can carry both Dominant and Recessive genes.
                </p>
                <p> Recessive genes produce the lighter colors. To get a diluted color, such as Lilac or Blue, you must have the same recessive gene from each parent, with no dominant genes getting in the way!
                </p>
                <p> Scientists are still figuring this all out and many gene “sets” are involved, but
                  thankfully enough is known for us Breeders to figure out what color and markings our kittens likely will have. Do not worry about it! You will fall in love with whatever kitten you fall in love with! ……. Let us do the data crunching.

A Mitted Ragdoll may have some white on the chest (called a Bib), on their tummy and face as well, but always less than Bicolors. If there is white on the face their nose must be dark and the white area cannot be the distinctive white V of the Bicolor.</p>
