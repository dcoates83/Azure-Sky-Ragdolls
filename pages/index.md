           Purebred Ragdoll should matter to the everyday owner, however.-->
              A Purebred Ragdoll from an ethical breeder who is
              <strong>registered with a credible registry</strong> such as TICA
              works hard to provide owners with a quality, healthy Ragdoll
              kittens
              <strong>without genetic defects or health problems.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>TICA mandates the breeder follow certain rules. </strong
              >Breeders may NEVER sell a cross breed and
              <strong>must work to eliminate genetic defects.</strong> All
              breeds are susceptible to their own genetic defects. In Ragdolls
              the most common defects that show up are HCM
              <strong>(hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)</strong> and PKD
              <strong>(polycystic kidney disease)</strong>.
              <em>These usually show up in the second year </em>AFTER you have
              completely fallen in love with your kitten.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>These defects are</em> <strong>irreversible</strong>
              <em>and cause</em> <strong>death</strong>. HCM prevalence is 30%
              in untested lines! It is entirely devastating to watch your
              beloved kitten suffer. Usually you must put it down to stop its
              suffering.

              from the lines they sell by buying only quality Kings and Queens
              and continuously striving to improve the quality of their cats.
              <strong>They do genetic and physical testing</strong> of their
              Kings and Queens to rule out genetic defects.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good breeder will
              <strong>always provide a health guarantee</strong> and a Sales
              contract. Your kitten is replaced if genetic defects occur, and
              you have a legal sales contract to back this up. Unfortunately,
              health guarantees mean a higher purchase prices because it costs
              us more to provide you with those quality kittens but generally
              this is worth it since you are avoiding costly health problems and
              devastating heartache.

              The International Cat Association (TICA) is respected worldwide as
              the leader registry of cats. Other cat fancy associations exist
              but currently TICA <em>is the one most sought after </em>for
              Breeders and Cat Fanciers due to its stringent policies protecting

              Sophia has been raised with cats since she was little; they are
              part of her family. She does offend them to no end when they are
              grown into adults as she insists that she must still clean their
              face and bottoms. As such all the kittens we raise do spend a
              significant amount of time looking like Elvis.
            </p>
            <p>
              We socialize our kittens well. They are part of our home and get
              used to all the strange noises and sites most homes have. Nanny
              Sophia of course is constantly “on the job”. Socialization before
              they are 2 months old is extremely important to having a
              well-balanced, happy cat.
