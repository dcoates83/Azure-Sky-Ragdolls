<h1 class="header-2">Upcoming Litters</h1>
<p>All litters will all be from foundation Seal Bicolor male Tzar.</p>
<p>Likely colors of kittens and dates of litters are listed but of course
Mother Nature does her own thing!</p>
<h3>Litters could be earlier or later or even the order switched. If
you place a deposit, we will notify who is pregnant when it is
known.</h3>
          <p>
           As Queens are bred and when we are sure they are pregnant, we
update every Depositor re anticipated litter birth date.
          </p>
<h3>Cats typically do not show any signs of pregnancy until second
month of pregnancy.</h3>
          <p>
           Cats’ gestation period is around 60 days.
          </p>
<h3>We space litters so Queens get the best possible care, kittens
get their best socialization and Mommas get a break.</h3>
